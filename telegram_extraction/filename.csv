266,-1001193342710,"People often ask what I think about #bitcoin’s long term price outlook. I believe there will be 3 major stages:

1⃣ Stage 1: Capturing gold's product market fit

This era is all about going from 0 to 500 million users. This might happen more *silently* than expected, as people may gain bitcoin exposure via their retirement plans.

I believe we are currently still in stage 1, as bitcoin still has about 20x before it is valued similar to gold.

2⃣ Stage 2: The boring era

This era, bitcoin price may continue to rise nominally as the monetary base expands (like gold currently), but the growth of bitcoin's real adoption may plateau.

Despite slowed adoption, goods and services may continue to get cheaper priced in bitcoin as rising world population, lost bitcoin and technological deflation are also all major tailwinds.

3⃣ Stage 3: The Balaji era

Part 1: The rapid collapse of USD as world reserve currency
Part 2: Hyper-bitcoinization, or adoption of BTC as world reserve currency

It's important to separate these two parts because part 1 will be just a rise in BTC for USD denomination, whereas part 2 will be the rise of bitcoin priced in ALL goods.

#Bitcoin is the only sustainable solution we humans will ever have. If Bitcoin does not solve this problem, nothing will.

You think Bitcoin is a fraud, that it is bad for the environment or only criminals use it?

Good for you. Bitcoin doesn't care and still will always be here for you no matter if in 2010, today or in 50 years from now.

Bitcoin does not remember. Bitcoin does not trust. Bitcoin does not differentiate. Bitcoin does not prefer. Bitcoin does not change.

Bitcoin only does one thing: staying like it is. For ever unchanged. Being a constant we have never seen before until the last human on earth is breathing and possibly even beyond.

You can hate it like you want. You can think of it what you want. And still Bitcoin will survive because in the end humanity always collectively found what's best for it.

Don't fall for division tactics. Their end game is to blow the issue out of proportions, establish a very ideologically-motivated community and create another fork/split.

It's not fatal for Bitcoin, but it slows down adoption and causes more confusion in times of banking crises and high inflation. What it does it to buy central bankers some more time as we fight.

Step 2) Bait the US into shooting themselves in their own foot by giving the entire world a reason to get off the USD standard, like a massive spree of money-printing & inflation (due to a Chinese lab-leaked coronavirus) or denying sovereign nations off SWIFT (due to a Russian invasion).

Step 3) While the US doesn't know what's happening, do a rapid 180 flip on #Bitcoin. Build a gigantic hashing infrastructure in Siberia. Rapidly become a global leader in Proof-of-Work tech.
